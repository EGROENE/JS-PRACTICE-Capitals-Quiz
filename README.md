# JS-PRACTICE-Capitals-Quiz
This is yet another practice project I completed using the NPM package 'readline-sync'. This program provides the user the chance to test their knowledge on the capital of each US state in a series of 50 multiple-choice questions, as well as tracks their score throughout the quiz and reports it at the end. As I used Node.js, the program runs in the terminal.
